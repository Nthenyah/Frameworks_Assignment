📊 CORD-19 Research Papers Analysis

This project is part of my Frameworks Assignment. The goal was to analyze the CORD-19 metadata dataset, perform some basic data cleaning and visualization, and then create a Streamlit web app to explore the findings interactively.

🎯 Objectives

Load and explore a real-world dataset (CORD-19 metadata).

Clean missing or inconsistent values.

Perform basic analysis (publication trends, top journals, etc.).

Visualize insights with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Build an interactive Streamlit app.

📂 Project Structure
Frameworks_Assignment/
│── cord19_analysis.ipynb     # Jupyter notebook with full analysis
│── app.py                    # Streamlit app
│── metadata_clean_sample.csv # Cleaned sample dataset used in analysis
│── README.md                 # Project documentation

⚙️ Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
Then install the required packages:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn streamlit

🚀 How to Run
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook

Open the notebook to view the analysis step by step:

jupyter notebook cord19_analysis.ipynb

2. Run the Streamlit App

To interact with the data using the web app:

streamlit run app.py


This will open the app in your browser at:
👉 http://localhost:8501/

📊 Key Insights

Publications increased significantly after 2020 as COVID-19 research accelerated.

Certain journals like BMC Infectious Diseases and Respiratory Research appeared frequently.

Word frequency in titles highlighted common terms such as COVID, SARS, virus, and respiratory.

📝 Notes

Only a sample dataset (metadata_clean_sample.csv) is included here since the full metadata.csv is too large for GitHub.

The analysis can be extended with more advanced NLP techniques for abstracts and titles.
